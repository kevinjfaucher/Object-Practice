    Block Scope: In JavaScript, const (like let) is block-scoped, meaning it is only a
    ccessible within the block {} in which it is defined. Each iteration of the loop creates a new block scope, 
    so the const book variable is redefined in every iteration. 

    This is why const works here; it doesn't prevent the reassignment of book on 
    subsequent iterations because each iteration is in a separate block.
